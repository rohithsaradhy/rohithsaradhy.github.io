                    <h2> Why A Carreer in Physics?</h2>
                    <p>
                      As a kid I was always intrigued by the way everything around me worked, of which electronics and
                      electrical appliances used to pique  my interest (it still does, along with many other things).
                       Earlier in my school days I read upon any scientific article that I could lay my hands on, and
                       used to do a bit of tinkering around by myself (opening up microwaves, radios, rc-cars etc.).
                        Then came a time when I started learning about electronics, and building small circuits (clap switch, timer circuits etc.)
                         but all these, were somewhat not complete. I yearned to know more about how these electronics were working,
                         in the most fundamental level. This is what led me to choose physics as a career.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After joining NISER, I enjoyed learning about the basic principles that were at work in the universe.
                      How we modeled day to day phenomenon, first considering the simplest models (which is far from reality)
                      and adding more parameter to meet the reality… How even though we could not get the perfect solutions
                      we managed to approximate it to fit our basic needs. The theory of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity
                      which baffles the common understandings of reality. The clever tricks that were used to extract the data, from experiments,
                      and meticulously modelling them. And how from these we can form the building blocks to understand the universe.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I came to the realization that science as a whole was not built in one day nor was it built by one person.
                    True, there were many eminent personalities in the scientific community that contributed a lot. But it is a culmination of
                    efforts of many scientists over the years. Individually the work might not have had a very large impact, but when more of these
                    small discoveries combined, they lead to a break through making it important to collaborate with other scientist and push the
                    frontiers of research.

                    <p>
                       I had the opportunity of going to <b>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</b>, Mumbai as a Visiting Students Summer Research Scholar. There I was involved in the development of the Post Collision Charge State Deflector for the ECR Ion Accelerator. The project introduced me to whole new horizon of developmental aspect. Design and simulating an entire chamber which was to be mounted as a part of the ongoing experiment. Gave me insight into how the dynamics of a world class research group functions as well as how to work as a team. Learnt about different types of detection methods used and accelerator physics as well as the sophisticated electronics that accompanied with it. Here Solidworks was used to develop the chamber and flanges (Learning a lot about the different types of flanges and sealing technologies). I also learnt about different vacuum technologies that were used in accelerators. During the stay in TIFR I was invited to visit many labs as part of the VSRP programme, which broadened my idea of the research front. I was also awarded the <b> BEST VSRP PROJECT AWARD 2015</b> for the same.

                    The second summer project introduced me to the X-ray diffraction machine and various techniques that were used. I wrote a<strong> Visual Basic</strong> code to run the <strong>HUBER SMC 9000 </strong>stepper motor controller and interfaced the DC motor coupled monochromator table fully automatic using an <strong>Arduino</strong>. Along with this I also learned how to interface stepper motor to a PC. The project gave me a thorough understanding of stepper motors, shift registers, ADC, DAC, Atmega 32 microcontroller, Arduino, and Raspberrypi. Also interfaced the X-Y stepper motor controlled stage of the Ion Beam Lab’s microbeam line. </p>

                    <p>
                       This is an experiment to study the highly efficient laser operation of praseodymium-doped LiYF4 in the green and red spectral range. I studied the frequency stability, stability criteria for the linear cavity, and the optimization of the linear cavity to maximize the green and red lasing. The pump radiation is delivered by a 1 W blue diode pumped solid-state laser at 444nm wavelength. Here I got to know about handling the delicate optical instruments, laser action, cavities and measurement techniques for wavelength, beam width, intensity profiles etc.

Detector to Study
Magnetostriction using Michelson
Interferometry</CENTER></strong></h4>
                    <p>
                      During the 8th semester of the Int. M.Sc. we were encouraged to pursue open ended experiments as a part of the teaching labs. Along with my colleage, we developed a photodiode detector to detect the fringe variations of the Michelson Interferometer in order to study the magnetostriction property of different materials. During the development of this detector the main problem we faced was that the noise due to the environmental vibrations drowned our signal and was solved by using a Low Pass Filter with a very low cut-off frequency. We implemented  a stepper motor controlled by an arduino to vary the voltage so that our signal of interest would be of very low frequency too and won't be cut-off by the LPF. Finally we were able to get really good results over the measurements without the detector. I also proposed a model to take into account the thermal expansion effects as well, due to the heating of the solenoid. This was the experiment that we implemented all the things we learned before and successfully achieved the objectives which boosted my confidence in doing more development oriented work.
