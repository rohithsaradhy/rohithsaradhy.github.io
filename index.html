                    <h2> Why A Career in Physics?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It was a cold summer night at the Institute of Physics(IOP) XRD facility that the stepper motor had finally clicked using the Huber Stepper Motor Controller(SMC). Eavesdropping on the RS-232 communication between the stock software and the Huber SMC
                        confirmed my belief that the Visual Basic application I had written to interface the machine was not at fault.  The problem was with
                        the way byte code for carriage return was sent to the machine in a Windows operating system.  Having been working on this project
                        for more than 2 months as a second year Int. M.Sc. student I couldn’t wait to tell my summer guide, Prof. P.V Satyam what the problem
                         had been all along.
                         Hearing this, he gave the “go ahead” signal for me to interface the X-Y stepper motor stage in the microbeam line of
                          the accelerator facility at IOP. And I began my expedition to set myself on the stage as an experimental physicist.
                      </p>
                          <p>
                          My research interests continued to mature, streamlined in the direction of developing experiments and instrumentation to explore the
                         unknown physics. Being selected for Visiting Students Research Programme at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research under the guidance of
                        Prof. L.C Tribedi gave me the opportunity to work with the ECR Ion Accelerator where I helped develop post-collision charge
                        state deflector. The satisfaction of developing one’s own experimental equipment with the endless possibility of doing exciting
                         new physics drove me further into seeking out such projects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The coursework at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, where I was admitted as an undergraduate
                         was also a decisive factor in shaping my interests and experience.  While the core courses instilled in me a deep
                          understanding of physics, the advanced courses set me apart from the crowd, coaching me in the areas of algorithms,
                           experimental techniques, information theory, high energy physics to name a few. Lab courses played a crucial role
                            in facilitating the grasp of what was taught in the theory courses.  I was fascinated by the ingenious methods
                             that were employed to explore the realm of the unknown such as the Michelson Interferometer, Lock-In Amplifier,
                              and Laser-Doppler Anemometer.  With the help of Dr Ashok Mohapatra, we developed a photo-diode detector to
                               replace the conventional measuring technique of the Michelson interferometer during one of the lab courses.
                                This exercise, along with the previous projects got me thinking about the essential requirement of a detector
                                 in any experiment.  And understanding detectors means devising more sensitive experiments with the ultimate
                                  aim of exploring the unexplored.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                    With the aim of understanding and building efficient detectors, I chose the field of gaseous detector development for
                    my Master’s thesis under the guidance of Prof. Bedangadas Mohanty.  Working with Bakelite RPC and studying charged
                     particle interaction with matter along with the simulation of the detector geometry using Geant4 has introduced me
                      to the parameters that characterise an efficient detector. Furthermore, I plan to extend this project to include
                      the study of neutral particle interactions with matter, develop and test proportional counters and use Geant4 to
                      simulate the Germanium detectors used in SuperCDMS experiment at SNOLab to see how fractional charges interact
                      with matter.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My immediate educational objectives are to acquire the expertise to build efficient, high-resolution detectors and implement
                       them in ongoing experiments to explore physics beyond the standard model.  And later set myself up as an experimental researcher,
                       studying and devising experiments to solve the problems that we have no solution for such as the matter-antimatter asymmetry,
                       dark matter and dark energy to name a few.

                      Primary focus of this project is to study and develop gas based detectors such as Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC), and Proportional Counters.
                      By fabricating and testing a 15x15 cm <sup>2</sup> RPC along with simulating the same detector geometries, various parameters of the detector were
                      studied, along with studying the interaction of charged particles in matter.  Furthermore, I am planning to extend this project to include
                       the study of neutral particle interaction with matter, develop and test proportional counters and use Geant4 to simulate the Germanium
                        detectors used in SuperCDMS experiment at SNOLAB to see how fractional charges interact with matter.  The end to which this project has
                        been initiated also includes establishing a detector lab at NISER.

                       This was the continuation of the work done in the summer of 2015. The Charge State Deflector(earlier developed; go below to see) was used to determine the post collision projectile charge states, enabling us to study the capture ratios at different energies. The first half of the project consisted of researching upon the different models that were applicable to this energy regime (low to intermediate where the velocity of the projectile is comparable to the orbital velocity), and second half consisted on tuning  the beam to reduce the background and getting the single capture cross-section for different target-projectile system and was compared with different models.                     </p>

                      <p>
15x15 cm<sup>2</sup> bakelite RPC was fabricated and tested in TIFR, INO Lab.Biasing was done in avalanche mode and a maximum high voltage of 15.8kV was applied with minimal leakage currents. The efficiency of the detector was tested for different biasing voltages. And a maximum efficiency of 75.1% was achieved at 15kV. Here I learnt the fabrication procedures and testing techniques that were used to develop bakelite RPC, and I was introduced into the wonderful world of Indian Neutrino Observatory testing labs. Got a glimpse of Field Programmable Gate Arrays, Different NIM Modules and the subtleties involved in fabricating an efficient RPC.

                    <h4 >  <center><strong class="color-red">Beam Optimization and Development of Post Collision Charge State Deflector for ECR Ion Accelerator </strong></h4></center>
                    <p>
                       Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Accelerator (ECRIA) is well known to produce low energy (keV), highly charged ions. The energetic ions from the ECRIA
                        can be made to collide with target atoms or molecules of our interest and by analysing different reaction products we can extract information about
                         the involved reaction mechanism. Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy is one of the techniques to study the momentum distributions of the post collision
                          recoil ions. A complete RIMS system needs a charge state analyser to determine the final charge state after collisions.  In keV projectile energy
                           range electron capture to the projectile is one of the dominant mechanisms. To separate out this channel from other possible reaction channels,
                            the post collision projectile charge state analysis is necessary.
                        To this end, I was involved in developing a Post Collision Charge State Deflector for the ECR Ion Accelerator. The project introduced
                         me to whole new horizon of developmental aspect. Design and simulating an entire chamber which was to be mounted as a part of the
                          ongoing experiment. Gave me insight into how the dynamics of a world class research group functions as well as how to work as a team.
                           Learnt about different types of detection methods used and accelerator physics as well as the sophisticated electronics that accompanied
                            with it. Here Solidworks was used to develop the chamber and flanges (Learning a lot about the different types of flanges and sealing
                            technologies). I also learnt about different vacuum technologies that were used in accelerators. During the stay in TIFR I was invited
                             to visit many labs as part of the VSRP programme, which broadened my idea of the research front. I was also awarded the
                             <b> BEST VSRP PROJECT AWARD 2015</b> for the same.

                    <p>
                    The second summer project introduced me to the X-ray diffraction machine and various techniques that were used. I wrote a<strong> Visual Basic</strong> code to run the <strong>HUBER SMC 9000 </strong>stepper motor controller and interfaced the DC motor coupled monochromator table fully automatic using an <strong>Arduino</strong>. Along with this I also learned how to interface stepper motor to a PC. The project gave me a thorough understanding of stepper motors, shift registers, ADC, DAC, Atmega 32 microcontroller, Arduino, and Raspberrypi. Also interfaced the X-Y stepper motor controlled stage of the Ion Beam Lab’s microbeam line. </p>

                       This is an experiment to study the highly efficient laser operation of praseodymium-doped LiYF4 in the green and red spectral range. I studied the frequency stability, stability criteria for the linear cavity, and the optimization of the linear cavity to maximize the green and red lasing. The pump radiation is delivered by a 1 W blue diode pumped solid-state laser at 444nm wavelength. Here I got to know about handling the delicate optical instruments, laser action, cavities and measurement techniques for wavelength, beam width, intensity profiles etc.

Detector to Study
Magnetostriction using Michelson
Interferometry</CENTER></strong></h4>
                    <p>
                      During the 8th semester of the Int. M.Sc. we were encouraged to pursue open ended experiments as a part of the teaching labs. Along with my colleage, we developed a photodiode detector to detect the fringe variations of the Michelson Interferometer in order to study the magnetostriction property of different materials. During the development of this detector the main problem we faced was that the noise due to the environmental vibrations drowned our signal and was solved by using a Low Pass Filter with a very low cut-off frequency. We implemented  a stepper motor controlled by an arduino to vary the voltage so that our signal of interest would be of very low frequency too and won't be cut-off by the LPF. Finally we were able to get really good results over the measurements without the detector. I also proposed a model to take into account the thermal expansion effects as well, due to the heating of the solenoid. This was the experiment that we implemented all the things we learned before and successfully achieved the objectives which boosted my confidence in doing more development oriented work.
